# CodeClause_Brain_tumour_detection.
Brain Tumour Detection using Data Science is the project's name.  On the MRI scan dataset, there are numerous well-known deep learning projects. The identification of brain tumours is one of them. On these MRI scans, transfer learning can be used to extract the necessary features for classification.
Alternately, you can start from scratch and train your own convolution neural network to recognise brain tumours. Python was the programming language utilised to create this project.
